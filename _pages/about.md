I'm a first-year PhD student at MIT in the [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/research/). My research interests are broadly in the intersection of algorithms and society, especially around fairness and privacy. 

Previously, I was a Trustee Scholar at the University of Southern California between 2016 - 2020 where I earned a bachelor's in Applied Math and a master's in Electrical Engineering. My undergraduate research spanned socially assistive robotics, deepfake detection, gentrification, and dark money on social media. 

Before joining MIT, I worked in the U.S. Intelligence Community from 2020 - 2022 as a forward deployed engineer for Palantir Technologies. I also worked on Siri at Apple as an intern in 2019.
